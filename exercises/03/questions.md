# TIE-50307 - Exercise 03 - Q&A

## 1. What is the goal of this exercise? What did you accomplish?
- Understand and debug a typical LKM (typically documentation is lacking)
- Modify the LKM module code to function as intended, and to pass an automated test script
- 
## 2. Where is the `evil-tests` script installed inside the image? Where is the accompanying data installed? Describe how this is set up in Yocto.
- evil-tests is located in /opt/evil-tests/sbin/evil-tests.sh
- data.txt is located in /opt/evil-tests/share/data.txt
- the files themselves are located in meta-tie50307\recipes-tests\evil-tests\files
- The tests recipe contains the paths to the files to install (evil-tests.sh and data.txt)
- evil-tests.bb contains the instructions to install the files for evil-tests

## 3. How are the LKM and `evil-tests` added to `core-image-minimal`? Briefly describe what sets apart the `evil-tests` recipe compared with most recipes included in `meta-groupXX`, `meta-pynq`, `meta-xilinx` and `poky`.
- the "recipies-core" recipe contains the core-image-minimal.bbappend file which ensures that the evil-mod and evil-tests recipes are appended to core-image-minimal recipe.
- the build/bblayers.conf is processed to include the meta-tie50307 in the build process and ensure the files end up inside the image
- evil-tests does not require any build and does not inherit "module" to produce an LKM


## 4. How many buffers does the `evil` LKM use? List their names, their size and their purpose. How is their memory allocated?
- evil has 2 buffers
- input_buf:
    - static assigned char array of size 1000 bytes (char = 1 byte)
    - buffers input to tasklet which stores data to data_storage
- data_storage:
    - used for reading/writing data using sysfs
    - allocated using kmalloc (GFP_KERNEL)
    - Size (1 Page - PAGE_SIZE) - 4096 bytes

## 5. How are user-input strings stored inside the module? How does the module iterate over this list? What's the loop end condition?
- strings are stored inside data_storage with store_evil function which uses a tasklet to write to the data_storage buffer.
-  The tasklet recieves the buffered data from input_buf, and replaces 'a' with ' ' before storing the data in data_storage using sprintf
- successive writes append strings to this data_storage array ('\0' between successive writes are overwritten) based on bytes_stored global variable
- show_evil function loops data_storage and writes to output buffer (buf) until it encounters '\0' to indicate end of string, reporting number of bytes read

## 6. What is the path for the `evil` LKM's sysfs entry? How is it determined? How is it mapped to the module functionality?
- /sys/kernel/evil_module/evil
- sysfs entry created with kobject_create_and_add("evil_module", kernel_kobj);
- evil file is created with sysfs_create_file(evil_kobj, &dev_attr_evil.attr)
- read/write functions are called show_evil and store_evil respectively and perform the required       tasks
- these functions are specified in device_attribute dev_attr_evil and are called when read/write is    requested 

## 7. What bugs did you find/fix? Categorize them and briefly describe each matching *category* (what's the *impact* of each *category*? How common do you *think* it is?)
Bugs:\

Memory Management\
    1) no memory allocated for tasklet - Serious: Segfault | uncommon: would cause segfault during development\
    2) evil_exit() tries to free tasklet memory before executing tasklet_kill - Serious: can cause kernel panic | common: easy mistake to make\
    3) evil_init() depending on errors, not all memory is free'd such as kfree(data_storage)
kobject_del(evil_kobj) - Mild: Memory leaks | common: easy mistake to forget to free allocated memory
    4) allocated , data_storage and input_buf should be initialised to 0 to avoid undefined behaviour with memset Mild: Memory leaks | common: easy mistake to make when allocating memory
Buffer handling\
    1) in show_evil() += used instead of = for sprintf return value  Serious: non functional code | uncommon: would cause errors during development
    2) store_evil() function needs to check for buffer overflow of input_buf when storing user-input strings and return an error (-1) when overflow would occur - Serious: Segfault | common: would cause segfault only in overflow cases\
Permissions\
    1) sysfs dev_attr_evil needs to be set to allow for r/w access (644 used) Serious: permmission denied | uncommon: would cause permission errors during development\


## 8. What are out-of-bounds accesses and stack overflows? Are they relevant for this exercise? What could be the consequences of such defects in a LKM?
- Out of bounds accesses are when we try access a memory location outside of the array(buffer) 
- Out of bounds accesses usually has "undefined behaviour". This might access some piece of memory already owned by the running process.
- Stack overflow occurs when the call stack pointer exceed the stack bounds. (Attempts an out of bound access) This is essentially a buffer overflow and affects in crashing the running processes

## 9. Feedback (what was difficult? what was easy? how would you improve it?)
- had some difficulty due to heading down the wrong path when fixing bugs, overcomplicated things
